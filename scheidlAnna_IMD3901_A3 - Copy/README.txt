When I initially went out to do the assignment I went through a bunch of ideas and tried them out. None of them really worked out or were
too much for the assignment so I started from scratch. I tried to think of cool minigames, and then came up with the four corner game.
One player has four different coloured corners they can choose to go to. Another player has to guess which corner they are in, or
alternatively try and avoid guessing the corner they are in so they survive.

I found a lot of things challenging. I had to scrap so many ideas which was frustrating. I had tried to work with physics but that
did not pan out and took up the majority of my working time on the assignment. The assignment is still kind of broken as there
are items that are still not passing through.

The moving to the different corners worked out well, after having to peruse through many youtube videos so I could recall aframe code.
I was able to get the html side set up and come up with a solid idea by the end.
